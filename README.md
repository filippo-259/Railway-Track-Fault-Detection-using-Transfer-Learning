# Railway-Track-Fault-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning
This project applies transfer learning with a pre-trained InceptionV3 model to classify images of railway tracks as either defective or non-defective. The goal is to develop an image classification model that can support predictive maintenance in the railway industry.
